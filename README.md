# bScript
This is just my silly attempt at building an interpreter in Java.

I have been following [this book](https://craftinginterpreters.com/), since I literally have 0 idea on how to actually build and design 
an interpreter. At some point, I plan to stray away from that.


### Plans
- Use this project in some other projects (that have a need for simple interpreted scripts,
so eventually this language should be able to make native calls to Java functions.
- Support some cool syntactic sugar (if I come up with any)
- Better error logging and stack traces
- Something else interesting that I can think of later
